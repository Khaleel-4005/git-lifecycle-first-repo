    <h1>Git Lifecycle & First Repo</h1>

    <p>This is my first Git push and pull practice.</p>
    <p>Change made from GitHub website.</p>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>Feature: added new paragraph from feature branch</p>
    <p>HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, using elements like <p> for paragraphs, <h1> for headings, and <img> for images. CSS is then used to style this content, defining aspects like colors, fonts, layout, and spacing, to control the visual presentation of the HTML elements. JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web page, allowing for features such as animated elements, form validation, and communication with servers to fetch data, enhancing the user experience beyond static content and styling.</p>
        
    <p>This line is added in feature/conflict-branch.</p>

    <p>This line is added in main branch for testing conflict.</p>
